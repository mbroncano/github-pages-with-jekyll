This is a collection of my personal hacks. I've been doing hacks of one sort or another for 30+ years at the time of writing, but I never thought of keeping a diary of what I was doing, the steps I took to accomplish it nor any related material. In these pages, I will try to keep a detailed description of these hacks.
