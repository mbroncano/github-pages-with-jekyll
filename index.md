This is a collection of my personal hacks. I've been doing hacks of one sort or another for 30+ years at the time of writing, but I never thought of keeping a diary of what I was doing, the steps I took to accomplish it nor any related material.
In this pages, I'll try to keep a detailed description on to how reproduce my own hacks, and hopefully also somebody else.
