# My Hack Log

This is a collection of my personal hacks. I've been doing hacks of one sort or another for 30+ years at the time of writing, but I never thought of keeping a diary of what I was doing, the steps I took to accomplish it nor anything else. A couple of days ago I spent an afternoon doing something I was afraid to forget how to maintain in a couple of months, so I decided to start a diary or may a logbook of the steps that I took.
So that's how things starts, right?
